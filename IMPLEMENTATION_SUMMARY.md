- ✅ Shows step-by-step instructions to students
- ✅ Improved visual hierarchy
- ✅ Better guidance on using the "Insert into Canvas" button

**Key Additions:**
```tsx
{/* How to Use Section */}
{moleculeData && (
  <div className="bg-blue-900/20 border border-blue-600/30 rounded-lg p-4 space-y-2">
    <p className="text-sm font-semibold text-blue-300">📚 How to Create a Reaction:</p>
    <ol className="text-sm text-blue-200 space-y-1 list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>Click "Insert into Canvas" to add this molecule</li>
      <li>Repeat for other molecules in your reaction</li>
      <li>Use the arrow tool to show reaction direction</li>
      <li>Add conditions above the arrow</li>
      <li>Arrange molecules to show the reaction</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
)}
```

### Already Integrated Files (No Changes Needed)

#### 2. `chem_canvas/src/components/Canvas.tsx`

**Why No Changes Needed:**
- ✅ Already had `onSelectMolecule` handler (lines 1309-1354)
- ✅ Already supported molecule shapes with `type: 'molecule'`
- ✅ Already had move and rotate tools
- ✅ Already supported SVG rendering of molecules
- ✅ Already stored molecules in the shapes array

**Existing Implementation:**
```tsx
{showMoleculeSearch && (
  <MoleculeSearch
    onClose={() => setShowMoleculeSearch(false)}
    onSelectMolecule={(moleculeData) => {
      const newMolecule: Shape = {
        id: `molecule-${Date.now()}`,
        type: 'molecule',
        startX: centerX,
        startY: centerY,
        endX: centerX + 100,
        endY: centerY + 100,
        moleculeData: { /* ... */ }
      };
      setShapes([...shapes, newMolecule]);
      canvasHistoryRef.current = [...shapes, newMolecule];
    }}
  />
)}
```

#### 3. `chem_canvas/src/components/ChemistryToolbar.tsx`

**Why No Changes Needed:**
- ✅ Already has "Search Molecules" button
- ✅ Already integrated with Molecule Search modal
- ✅ Already has proper icon and tooltip
