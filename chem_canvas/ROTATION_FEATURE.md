# Shape Rotation Feature 🔄

## Overview
Shapes can now be **rotated** to any angle after being drawn, just like professional design software. Combined with the Move tool, you have complete control over shape positioning and orientation.

## The Rotate Tool

### What Is It?
A dedicated tool that allows you to:
- ✅ Select shapes
- ✅ Rotate them in any direction  
- ✅ Adjust orientation precisely
- ✅ Create rotated molecules and diagrams

### How to Find It
1. Look at the **Chemistry Tools** panel (left sidebar)
2. Find the **Rotate** tool button (with rotating arrow icon 🔄)
3. Click it to activate

### Visual Indicators
When Rotate Tool is active:
- **Tool button highlights in blue** → Rotate tool is selected
- **Dashed cyan circle appears** → Shape is selected
- **Drag to rotate** → Shape rotates around its center

## How to Rotate Shapes

### Simple Rotation Process
```
1. Click the ROTATE TOOL button
   → Button turns blue (active)

2. Right-click on the shape you want to rotate
   → Dashed cyan circle appears (selected)

3. Drag your mouse in circular motion
   → Shape rotates as you drag
   → Rotation angle updates in real-time

4. Release mouse
   → Shape stays at new rotation angle
```

### Visual Example

#### Before Rotation
```
┌────────────────┐
│                │
│    ▲           │  (Triangle pointing up)
│   /│\          │
│  / │ \         │
│                │
└────────────────┘
```

#### Rotate Tool Selected + Right-Click → Drag Circular
```
┌────────────────┐
│                │
│   ◯ → ◇ → ◄ → ▼  (Rotating...)
│                │
└────────────────┘
```

#### After Release
```
┌────────────────┐
│                │
│    ▼           │  (Triangle pointing down)
│   \│/          │
│    │           │
│                │
└────────────────┘
```

## Rotation Controls

## Advanced Techniques

### Complete Shape Transformation
```
Steps to perfectly position a shape:

1. DRAW
   └─→ Create shape with any tool

2. MOVE
   └─→ Select Move Tool
   └─→ Click & drag to position

3. ROTATE
   └─→ Select Rotate Tool
   └─→ Right-click & drag to rotate

4. FINE-TUNE
   └─→ Move again if needed
   └─→ Rotate again if needed
   └─→ Repeat until perfect
```

### Creating Rotated Molecules
```
Example: Rotated benzene structure

1. Draw hexagon (benzene ring)
2. Position with Move Tool
3. Rotate 30° with Rotate Tool
4. Add carbon atoms
5. Position atoms at rotated vertices
6. Result: Perfectly oriented molecule ✓
```

### Precise Angle Control
```
Tips for exact angles:
- Small drag movements = precise angles
- Large drag movements = fast rotations
- Drag farther from center for better control
- Watch shape orientation closely
```

## Rotation Properties

### How Rotation Works

- **Center Point**: Shape rotates around its center
- **Angle Range**: 0° to 360° (0° is original position)
- **Direction**: Clockwise dragging = clockwise rotation
- **Precision**: Angle updates continuously while dragging
- **Storage**: Rotation is saved with shape

### Rotation Angles

```
Common rotation angles:

0°   = Original position →
90°  = Quarter turn ↓
180° = Half turn ←
270° = Three-quarter turn ↑
45°  = Diagonal angle ↘
```

## Visual Feedback

### Selection During Rotation

## Tips & Tricks

### ✅ Best Practices
- Always rotate AFTER positioning shapes
- Use grid for alignment references
- Make small movements for precise angles
- Keep rotations symmetrical where appropriate
- Test different angles to find best view

### ⚠️ Common Issues
- ❌ Rotating while still drawing
  → Solution: Finish drawing, then rotate
- ❌ Can't find Rotate Tool
  → Solution: Look in Chemistry Tools panel
- ❌ Shape jumping around
  → Solution: Right-click at shape center, drag slowly
- ❌ Wrong angle
  → Solution: Drag again to adjust, rotation is editable anytime

### 🎯 Precision Tips
- Drag in circle around shape
- Consistent dragging distance = consistent angle control
- Farther from center = better precision
- Small movements for fine adjustments
- Undo if needed, then try again

## Troubleshooting

### Rotation Not Working?
**Problem**: Shape doesn't rotate when dragging
**Solutions**:
1. Check Rotate Tool button is highlighted (blue)
2. Right-click on shape (not left-click)
3. Try Ctrl+Right-click as alternative
4. Drag in circular motion around shape

### Shape Rotates Wrong Direction?
**Problem**: Shape rotates opposite to expected
**Solutions**:
1. Drag in opposite direction (counterclockwise)
2. Drag farther from center for better control
3. Start with full 360° rotation to test

### Can't Control Rotation Precisely?
**Problem**: Rotation angle jumps around
**Solutions**:
1. Drag more slowly
2. Start drag farther from shape center
3. Make small movements only
4. Drag in smooth circular motion

### Shape Position Changes When Rotating?
**Problem**: Shape moves when trying to rotate
**Solutions**:
1. Right-click exactly on shape center
2. Ensure Move Tool is not active
3. Avoid clicking outside shape boundary
4. Try right-clicking at exact center point
