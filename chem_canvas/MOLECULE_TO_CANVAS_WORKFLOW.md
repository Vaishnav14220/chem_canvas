## Quick Start: 3 Steps to Create a Reaction

### Step 1️⃣: Open Molecule Search

You have **two ways** to open the Molecule Search:

**Option A: Chemistry Toolbar**
- Click the **Beaker Icon** (🧪) in the top-left to toggle Chemistry Tools
- Look for the **"Search Molecules"** button (microscope icon 🔬) in the Chemistry toolbar
- Click it to open the search dialog

**Option B: Canvas Controls**
- Click the **Atom Icon** (⚛️) in the top-right of the canvas
- This also opens the Molecule Search

### Step 2️⃣: Search & Select Molecules

1. **Enter a molecule name** in the search box
   - Try: water, benzene, ethanol, glucose, methane, CO2, etc.
   - Use IUPAC names for more specific results

2. **Click "Search"** button to find the molecule

3. **Preview the 2D structure** 
   - You'll see the molecular formula
   - Molecular weight is displayed
   - Click **"View 3D"** to see it in 3D viewer (MolView)

4. **Click "Insert into Canvas"** button
   - The molecule structure will be added to your canvas
   - It appears as a 2D SVG drawing

### Step 3️⃣: Build Your Reaction

Once molecules are on the canvas, you can:

1. **Add Reaction Arrows**
   - Select the **Arrow tool** (→) from Chemistry Tools
   - Click and drag on canvas to draw arrow from reactants to products
   - Multiple arrows supported

2. **Arrange Molecules**
   - Select **Move tool** (cross arrows)
   - Click molecules to select them
   - Drag to position them
   - Left side: Reactants
   - Right side: Products

3. **Add Conditions**
   - Use **Text tool** to add conditions above the arrow
   - Common conditions: Δ (heat), catalyst name, pressure, time, etc.
   - Example: "Heat", "Pt catalyst", "1 atm", "100°C"

4. **Add Plus Signs & Other Symbols**
   - Use **Plus tool** (➕) to separate multiple reactants/products
   - Use **Minus tool** (➖) for ions
   - Use **Equal tool** (⇌) for equilibrium

5. **Customize**
   - Change **colors** from the color palette
   - Adjust **brush size** for different element sizes
   - Use **Rotate tool** to orient molecules

## Example Workflow: Combustion of Methane

```
CH₄ + O₂  ──Heat──>  CO₂ + H₂O
```

**Steps:**
1. Search for "methane" → Insert it
2. Search for "oxygen" → Insert it
3. Add Plus sign between them
4. Draw arrow from left to right with text "Heat"
5. Search for "carbon dioxide" → Insert it
6. Search for "water" → Insert it
7. Add Plus sign between products
8. Adjust positions and sizes as needed

## Tips & Tricks

💡 **Pro Tips:**
- **Search by formula**: Try "H2O" or "CO2" in addition to names
- **View 3D first**: Click "View 3D" to understand molecule structure before adding
- **Color-code**: Use different colors for reactants vs products
- **Align properly**: Use grid to align molecules in neat rows
- **Check your work**: Use the "Check" button to verify your reaction notation

🎯 **Common Reactions to Practice:**
- Photosynthesis: CO₂ + H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂
- Neutralization: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O
- Combustion: C + O₂ → CO₂
- Double displacement: AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Molecule not found
- ✓ Try alternative names (e.g., "acetic acid" vs "ethanoic acid")
- ✓ Try chemical formula (e.g., "CH3COOH")
- ✓ Check spelling carefully

**Issue:** Molecule structure looks wrong
- ✓ Click "View 3D" to verify you have the right molecule
- ✓ Try searching with a more specific name

**Issue:** Can't move molecule after adding it
- ✓ Make sure you have the **Move tool** selected
- ✓ Click on the molecule first to select it (cyan circle appears)
- ✓ Then drag it to reposition

**Issue:** Want to remove a molecule
- ✓ Select the molecule with Move tool
- ✓ It will be highlighted with cyan circle
- ✓ Press Delete key or select a different area
