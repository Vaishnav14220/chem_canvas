# Move Tool Guide - Professional Shape Repositioning 🎯

## Overview
The **Move Tool** makes it easy to reposition shapes after drawing, just like Canvas, Figma, or Adobe Creative Suite. Shapes are now as editable and movable as in professional design software.

## The Move Tool

### What Is It?
A dedicated tool in the Chemistry Toolbar that allows you to:
- ✅ Select existing shapes
- ✅ Drag them to new positions
- ✅ See visual selection indicators
- ✅ Adjust diagram layout precisely

### How to Find It
1. Look at the **Chemistry Tools** panel (left sidebar)
2. Find the **Move** tool button (with 4-arrow icon ⬌)
3. Click it to activate

### Visual Indicators
When Move Tool is active:
- **Tool button highlights in blue** → Move tool is selected
- **Dashed cyan circle appears** → Shape is selected
- **Circular selection box shows** → Size and position boundaries

## Step-by-Step Usage

### Drawing Phase
```
1. Select any shape tool (Circle, Square, Arrow, etc.)
2. Click on canvas
3. Drag to desired size
4. Release - shape appears on canvas
```

### Moving Phase
```
1. Click the MOVE TOOL button (top of Chemistry Tools)
2. The tool button turns blue ← Move mode is active
3. Click on the shape you want to move
   → Dashed cyan circle appears (shape is selected)
4. Drag the shape to new position
   → Shape follows your mouse
5. Release to place in new location
   → Shape stays in new position
```

### Visual Example

#### Before Moving
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Canvas                 │
│                        │
│    ●  (circle)         │
│    ■  (square)         │
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘
```

#### Select Move Tool → Click Shape
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Canvas                 │
│                        │
│    ◯  (selected)       │  ← Dashed cyan circle
│    ■  (square)         │
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘
   Move Tool = Active ✓
```

#### Drag to New Position
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Canvas                 │
│  ┌─────────────────┐   │
│  │                 │   │
│  │      ◯          │   │ ← Moving...
│  │  ■  (square)    │   │
│  │                 │   │
│  └─────────────────┘   │
└────────────────────────┘
```

#### Release to Place
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Canvas                 │
│                        │
│         ●              │ ← New position!
│         ■              │
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Moving Multiple Shapes
```
Process:
1. Move first shape
   → Select shape → Drag → Release
2. Move second shape
   → Select shape → Drag → Release
3. Repeat for all shapes
4. Create perfectly aligned diagram
```

### Creating Complex Diagrams
```
Example: Benzene molecule

Step 1: Draw hexagon (benzene ring)
Step 2: Move it to center
Step 3: Draw circle for first carbon
Step 4: Move circle to hexagon vertex
Step 5: Repeat for all atoms
Step 6: Add all bonds
Result: Perfect molecular structure ✓
```

### Precise Alignment
```
Tips for professional diagrams:
- Use canvas grid as guide (toggle grid on/off)
- Make small movements for fine adjustments
- Keep shapes at consistent distances
- Align elements symmetrically
- Use visual balance
```

## On-Canvas Instructions

### Help Panel
A help panel appears at top-left showing:
```
💡 How to Move Shapes:
1. Select Move Tool
2. Click on a shape
3. Drag to new position
4. Release to place
```

This is always visible to remind you how to move shapes!

## Selection Indicators

### Visual Feedback

When a shape is selected, you see:
- **Dashed cyan circle** (🔵 - - - - -)
- **Centered on shape** (perfectly at the middle)
- **Shows interaction zone** (how far you can click)
- **Disappears when released** (shape deselected)

### Colors & Styling
- **Selection Circle**: Cyan (#0ea5e9) with dashed pattern
- **Line Width**: 3px for visibility
- **Alpha**: 80% transparency (semi-transparent)
- **Shape**: Perfect circle around shape center

## Professional Workflow

## Tips & Tricks

### ✅ Best Practices
- Always move shapes AFTER drawing all elements
- Use grid for alignment reference
- Keep consistent spacing between shapes
- Position most important element at center
- Work from center outward for balance

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes
- ❌ Trying to move while drawing tool is active
  → Solution: Select Move Tool first!
- ❌ Can't find Move Tool button
  → Solution: Look in Chemistry Tools panel
- ❌ Shape won't move
  → Solution: Make sure you're clicking ON the shape

### 🎯 Alignment Tips
- Use grid for reference alignment
- Keep atoms evenly spaced around benzene rings
- Center reaction arrows horizontally
- Align reactants and products vertically

## Troubleshooting

### Move Tool Not Working?
**Problem**: Clicking shapes doesn't select them
**Solutions**:
1. Check that Move Tool button is highlighted (blue)
2. Click directly ON the shape (not near it)
3. Make sure shapes are drawn (not in drawing mode)
4. Try clicking closer to shape center

### Shape Jumps When Moving?
**Problem**: Shape position jumps unexpectedly
**Solutions**:
1. Click at center of shape, not edge
2. Drag smoothly without releasing
3. Ensure zoom level is normal (100%)

### Shapes Overlap?
**Problem**: Shapes are drawn on top of each other
**Solutions**:
1. Use Move Tool to reposition
2. Last drawn shape is on top
3. Drag shapes to separate locations

### Can't Select Right Shape?
**Problem**: Wrong shape gets selected
**Solutions**:
1. Last drawn shape selects first (on top)
2. Move top shape away first
3. Then select shape underneath

   - Execute efficiently

### 4. **Move Systematically**
   - Move shapes row by row
   - Or group by molecule
   - Consistent, organized approach

### 5. **Final Alignment**
   - Use move tool for fine adjustments
   - Small movements for precision
   - Professional result

## Summary
