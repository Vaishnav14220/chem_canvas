# Single Resizable Arrow Drawing Feature 🎯

## Overview
The arrow drawing tool has been enhanced to allow users to draw **one arrow at a time** with **live resize preview**, matching professional design software like Canvas, Figma, and Adobe Creative Suite.

## Feature Description

### How It Works

1. **Select Arrow Tool** - Click the arrow button in Chemistry Tools
2. **Click on Canvas** - Click and hold at the starting point (arrow tail)
3. **Drag to Resize** - Move mouse while holding to see live preview
4. **Release Mouse** - Release to finalize the arrow position and size
5. **Arrow is Complete** - The arrow is now part of your drawing

### Single Arrow Behavior
- Only **one arrow** can be drawn per mouse action
- Arrow is **live-previewed** while dragging
- Arrow **automatically finalizes** when you release the mouse
- **Resizable** by dragging endpoint
- **Clean appearance** - no trailing artifacts

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
// Arrow state tracks one active arrow
const [arrowState, setArrowState] = useState<{
  startX: number;        // Tail position (where mouse started)
  startY: number;
  endX: number;          // Head position (current mouse position)
  endY: number;
  isDrawing: boolean;    // Currently drawing or finalized
} | null>(null);

// Store canvas image for redraw optimization
const imageDataRef = useRef<ImageData | null>(null);
```

### Drawing Process

#### 1. Start Drawing (Mouse Down)
```typescript
// Save current canvas state
imageDataRef.current = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

// Initialize arrow state
setArrowState({
  startX: x,
  startY: y,
  endX: x,      // Initially same as start
  endY: y,
  isDrawing: true
});
```

#### 2. Live Preview (Mouse Move)
```typescript
// While arrow is being drawn:
// 1. Restore saved canvas state (prevents ghosting)
// 2. Redraw grid if enabled
// 3. Update endX, endY to current mouse position
// 4. Draw arrow with current preview position
```

#### 3. Finalize (Mouse Up)
```typescript
// Set isDrawing to false
// Keep arrow on canvas with finalized position
// Ready for next arrow or other tools
```

## Visual Workflow

## Key Features

### ✅ Live Preview
- Arrow is previewed in **real-time** while dragging
- No lag or delay
- Smooth mouse tracking

### ✅ No Ghosting
- Canvas restored before each preview frame
- Only current arrow visible
- Clean appearance

### ✅ Canvas State Preservation
- Background and grid maintained during drawing
- Other drawing elements not affected
- Only arrow tool behaves differently

### ✅ Automatic Finalization
- Arrow automatically completes on mouse release
- No extra clicks needed
- Ready for next action

### ✅ Resizable Positioning
- Adjust arrow size by dragging endpoint
- Precise control over arrow position
- Professional appearance

## Customization

The arrow inherits settings from drawing tools:

| Setting | Source | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Color** | Color palette | Arrow fill & outline color |
| **Size** | Brush size slider | Arrow line width & head size |
| **Canvas** | Background toggle | Arrow visibility on dark/white |

## Chemistry Applications

### Perfect For:
- **Reaction Arrows** (A → B)
- **Mechanism Steps** (Multi-step reactions)
- **Electron Flow** (Curved mechanisms)
- **Transformation Indicators**
- **Process Flows**

### Example Reaction:
```
CH₄ + 2O₂  ────➤  CO₂ + 2H₂O
           Δ, catalyst
           
(Arrow shows direction and conditions)
```

## User Experience Benefits

✅ **Intuitive Drawing** - Click, drag, release workflow
✅ **Live Feedback** - See arrow while dragging
✅ **Professional Quality** - Filled arrowheads with outlines
✅ **Precision Control** - Exact positioning and sizing
✅ **No Frustration** - One arrow per action, no accidents
✅ **Familiar Pattern** - Matches design software behavior

## Comparison with Previous Implementation

### Before ❌
- Arrows drawn on every mouse move
- Multiple arrows with single drag
- No preview
- Harder to control

### After ✅
- One arrow per mouse action
- Live preview while dragging
- Clean appearance

- Professional behavior

## Technical Details

### Canvas State Management
- **Canvas State Stored**: `imageDataRef.current` saves pixel data
- **Efficient Redraw**: Only canvas content restored, not DOM
- **Grid Redrawn**: Grid reappears if enabled
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated redraw

### Arrow Finalization
- Arrow saved when mouse released
- `arrowState.isDrawing` set to false
- Arrow remains on canvas
- Ready for next drawing action

### Integration with Other Tools
- Arrow tool behavior **isolated** from other tools
- Other tools use **original drawing logic**
- No interference between tools
- Smooth tool switching

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Curved arrows (for electron flow)
- [ ] Double-headed arrows (reversible reactions)
- [ ] Arrow endpoint editing (adjust after drawing)
- [ ] Arrow styles (solid, dashed, dotted)
- [ ] Arrow rotation
- [ ] Arrow duplication
- [ ] Undo/redo for individual arrows
- [ ] Arrow labels/annotations

## Chemistry-Specific Features

### Reaction Mechanisms
```
Step 1: R-X  ──────➤  R⁺ + X⁻  (SN1 heterolytic cleavage)
Step 2: Nu⁻ ──────➤  R-Nu     (Nucleophilic attack)
Result: R-Nu (Product)
```

### Equilibrium Reactions
```
Option 1: Single arrows (directional)
A + B  ──────➤  C + D

Option 2: Reverse arrows (future enhancement)
A + B  ⇌  C + D  (reversible)
```

### Multi-Step Synthesis
```
Starting material
       ↓ (Arrow 1: reagent, conditions)
Intermediate 1
       ↓ (Arrow 2: reagent, conditions)
Intermediate 2
       ↓ (Arrow 3: reagent, conditions)
Final Product
