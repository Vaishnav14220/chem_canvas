Is Eraser tool selected?\n   → Click eraser button to be sure\n   \n2. Is Ctrl key being held?\n   → Try holding Ctrl, count to 3, then click\n   \n3. Is mouse on canvas?\n   → Make sure clicking on white canvas area\n   \nRetry:\n1. Click Eraser tool (ensure selected)\n2. Hold Ctrl for 2 seconds\n3. Click on canvas while holding\n4. Check console immediately\n```\n\n### Flow 2: Lasso Started But No Points Added\n\n```\nQ: See \"Lasso selection started\" but NOT \"Lasso point added\"?\n\nA: This means:\n- Lasso activated correctly ✓\n- But mouse movement not detected ✗\n\nCheck:\n1. Did you DRAG the mouse?\n   → Click and HOLD, then MOVE\n   → Don't just click once\n   \n2. Did you hold Ctrl throughout?\n   → Ctrl must be held during dragging\n   → If released, dragging might stop working\n   \nRetry:\n1. Hold Ctrl\n2. Click on canvas\n3. DRAG (move mouse while clicking)\n4. Watch console for \"Lasso point added\" messages\n```\n\n### Flow 3: Lasso Completed But Shapes Not Erased\n\n```\nQ: See \"Lasso selection complete\" but shapes remain?\n\nA: Shapes were inside lasso boundary but centers outside.\n\nCheck console for:\n\"Shape at X Y inside lasso: false\"\n↑ This means shape center is NOT inside lasso\n\nSolutions:\n1. Draw lasso CLOSER to shape centers\n2. Make lasso BIGGER\n3. Draw AROUND the shape centers (not edges)\n\nRetry:\n1. Draw bigger shapes first (easier targets)\n2. Draw lasso completely around each shape\n3. Ensure shape centers are clearly inside\n4. Release and check results\n```\n\n### Flow 4: Everything Works But Line Not Visible\n\n```\nQ: Console shows all messages but can't see golden line?\n\nA: Visual rendering issue, but functionality works.\n\nCheck:\n1. Canvas background is DARK?\n   → Golden line shows better on dark\n   → Light background makes it hard to see\n   \n2. Drawing SLOWLY enough?\n   → Fast drawing might not render all points\n   → Try drawing slower\n   \nVerify:\n- Look at console messages\n- If messages appear, feature IS working\n- Visual feedback is secondary\n\nSolution:\n1. Switch to dark canvas background\n2. Draw slower next time\n3. Trust the console logs\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📋 TESTING CHECKLIST\n\n### Pre-Test\n- [ ] App is running (localhost:1760)\n- [ ] Browser console is open (F12)\n- [ ] Canvas has content (drew some shapes)\n- [ ] Eraser tool is available in toolbar\n\n### Test Execution\n- [ ] Selected Eraser tool\n- [ ] Held Ctrl key\n- [ ] Clicked on canvas\n- [ ] Saw \"Lasso selection started\" in console\n- [ ] Dragged mouse around\n- [ ] Saw \"Lasso point added\" messages\n- [ ] Released mouse\n- [ ] Saw \"Lasso selection complete\" message\n\n### Verification\n- [ ] Console shows shape checks (\"inside lasso: true/false\")\n- [ ] Console shows shape count before/after\n- [ ] Canvas updated (shapes erased or not as expected)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 MOST COMMON MISTAKES\n\n### ❌ Mistake 1: Not Holding Ctrl\n```\nWrong:  Click canvas → Drag\nRight:  Hold Ctrl → Click → Drag (while holding Ctrl)\n```\n\n### ❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Tool Selected\n```\nWrong:  Select Circle → Hold Ctrl → Draw\nRight:  Select Eraser → Hold Ctrl → Draw\n```\n\n### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Dragging\n```\nWrong:  Click once and release (no drag)\nRight:  Click and drag (hold click while moving)\n```\n\n### ❌ Mistake 4: Drawing Too Small\n```\nWrong:  Tiny lasso with just 1-2 pixels movement\nRight:  Substantial lasso with 20+ pixels\n```\n\n### ❌ Mistake 5: Dragging Outside Canvas\n```\nWrong:  Click on canvas, drag outside window\nRight:  Keep dragging within canvas area\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS\n\n### You'll Know It's Working When:\n\n✓ Console shows \"Lasso selection started\" immediately after Ctrl+Click  \n✓ Console shows multiple \"Lasso point added\" messages while dragging  \n✓ Console shows \"Lasso selection complete with X points\" after release  \n✓ Some shapes show \"inside lasso: true\" in console  \n✓ Canvas shows reduced shape count after lasso  \n✓ Can draw another lasso immediately after  \n\n---\n\n## 🔧 IF STILL STUCK\n\n### Provide This Information:\n\n1. **Full console output** (copy-paste from console)\n2. **Browser type** (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge)\n3. **Canvas background** (light/dark)\n4. **Number of test shapes** (1/2/3/more)\n5. **Screenshots** if possible\n6. **Error messages** (if any)\n\n### Documents to Reference:\n- `LASSO_QUICK_FIX.md` - Quick summary\n- `LASSO_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` - Full guide\n- `LASSO_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting\n- `README_LASSO_ERASER.md` - Feature overview\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 NEXT STEPS\n\n1. **Open console now** (F12)\n2. **Follow the steps** above\n3. **Watch console** for messages\n4. **Report what you see**\n5. **Try suggestions** if not working\n\n**The console is your debugging tool - use it!**\n\n---\n\n**Ready?
