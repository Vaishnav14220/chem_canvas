# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - API KEY EXPOSURE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è INCIDENT SUMMARY

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Issue**: Gemini API keys were hardcoded in the repository

## What Happened

Your GitHub repository contained hardcoded API keys in:
- `chem_canvas/src/App.tsx` (line 85)
- `chem_canvas/src/firebase/apiKeys.ts` (lines 5-10)

These keys were exposed in your Git history and could be accessed by anyone with repository access.

## ‚úÖ Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. **All hardcoded API keys removed** ‚úÖ
   - Removed from `src/App.tsx`
   - Removed from `src/firebase/apiKeys.ts`
   - Code now never exposes full API keys

### 2. **Secure Firebase storage implemented** ‚úÖ
   - API keys stored in `admin/apiKeys/keys` Firestore collection
   - Protected with Firestore security rules
   - Only metadata exposed to client (masked keys)

### 3. **User-based key management** ‚úÖ
   - Users now provide their own API keys via Settings UI
   - Keys stored locally in browser localStorage (never in code)
   - Keys validated before storage

### 4. **New secure service created** ‚úÖ
   - `src/services/secureApiKeyService.ts`
   - Provides safe API key operations
   - Never logs full keys to console
   - Masks keys for display (e.g., `AIzaSy...eST8s`)

### 5. **Enhanced documentation** ‚úÖ
   - `chem_canvas/SECURITY_API_KEYS.md` - Complete security guide
   - Implementation examples
   - Best practices for key rotation

## üî¥ ACTION REQUIRED FROM YOU

### URGENT: Rotate Your API Keys

1. **Delete all exposed keys immediately:**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Select your project
   - Navigate to APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
   - Delete all API keys that were in this repository

2. **Create new API keys:**
   - Create new Gemini API keys
   - Update your `.env.local` if using one (NOT committed to git)
   - Never hardcode them again

3. **Notify users** (if applicable):
   - Inform them to add their own API keys via Settings
   - Point them to the security guide

### PREVENT FUTURE EXPOSURE

1. **Check your GitHub history:**
   ```bash
   # See commits that modified these files
   git log --oneline chem_canvas/src/App.tsx
   git log --oneline chem_canvas/src/firebase/apiKeys.ts
   ```

2. **Consider BFG cleanup** (if exposing keys is critical):
   ```bash
   # Warning: This rewrites git history
   bfg --delete-files "*.env" --no-blob-protection
   ```

3. **Enable branch protection:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Branch protection
   - Require code review before merge
   - Enable dismiss stale PR approvals

4. **Enable secret scanning:**
   - GitHub Settings ‚Üí Code security & analysis
   - Enable "Secret scanning" and "Push protection"

## üìã Files Modified

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src/App.tsx` | Removed hardcoded API key | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| `src/firebase/apiKeys.ts` | Removed hardcoded keys array | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| `src/firebase/auth.ts` | Updated to use secure methods | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| `src/services/secureApiKeyService.ts` | Created new secure service | ‚úÖ New |
| `SECURITY_API_KEYS.md` | Created comprehensive guide | ‚úÖ New |
| `.gitignore` | Already includes `.env` | ‚úÖ Verified |

## üîí New Architecture

### Before (INSECURE) ‚ùå
```
Hardcoded in App.tsx ‚Üí Stored in localStorage ‚Üí Used for API calls
(Exposed in Git history)
```

### After (SECURE) ‚úÖ
```
User Settings UI ‚Üí localStorage (local only) ‚Üí Used for API calls
(Never in git, never exposed in code)

Firebase Admin Collection ‚Üí Protected by Firestore rules
(Only for admin key management)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è How to Use Now

### For End Users
1. Click Settings ‚öôÔ∏è in the app
2. Enter your personal Gemini API key
3. Click "Save Securely"
4. Key is stored locally in your browser

### For Developers
1. Get your API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Never commit it to git
3. Store in `.env.local` (listed in `.gitignore`)
4. Or enter via UI when running the app

### For Admins (Firebase Setup)
- Use Firebase Admin SDK from a **secure backend only**
- Never expose keys in frontend code
- See `chem_canvas/SECURITY_API_KEYS.md` for details
