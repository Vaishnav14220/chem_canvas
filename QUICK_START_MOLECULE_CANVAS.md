## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Molecule not found | Try different name or formula |
| Molecule not showing | Wait 1-2 seconds, refresh page |
| Can't move molecule | Make sure Move tool is selected |
| Molecule looks small | Use Resize handles or zoom in |

## Pro Tips 💡

✨ **Best Practices:**
- Search by both name and formula
- View 3D structure for complex molecules
- Use zoom to see details
- Color-code reactants vs products
- Save frequently

🚀 **Common Reactions:**
- Combustion: CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
- Photosynthesis: CO₂ + H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂
- Neutralization: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O
- Oxidation: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
